			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>We needed to make a html file from scratch that was titled and called hello world, that also included a paragraph about us and our partner.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>One of the problems that arose was my inability to get the homepage items centered.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>We think we learned a lot about CSS and html, I learned how to center items using flexboxes.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<div id="output">
						<p>We were able to make our own respective html webpages that were about ourselves. We were able to make the CSS pop!</p>
