			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-Solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Trying to figure out the Pseudocoding heiarchy and general language was hard.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Some problems that arose were trying to figure out the game logic or Rock-Paper-Scissors. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I think this assignment helped me develop more CS rhetoric and understanding.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<div id="output">
					<p>I am now able to pseudocode. Here are the psuedocodes for tasks:</p>

					<pre><code>
	//How to make Pasta:
		//Grab everything needed: tomato sauce, dry noodles, measuring cups, pot, salt, bowls, stirring spoon, colander, forks.
		//Turn stove to medium heat and place pot.
			//Add 6 cups of water to the pot.
				//Cover the pot with a lid to speed up heating. 
				//Wait for water to start boiling.
				//Season the water (optional).
				//Add pasta noodles once the water starts to boil.
					//Cook for around 15-20 minutes or until done, stirring occasionally.
					//Once pasta is cooked, take out the colander, place it in the sink, and dump the pasta in.
		//While the pot is still hot, you can make your own sauce, add butter, or just pour the premade tomato sauce.
		//Combine pasta noodles and stir.
		//Serve and enjoy.

		//Assign a player input box, which they can only choose rock paper or scissors
		//Make a randomizer to have the ai choose any element
		  //Accept Player input
			//Compare player input to computer chosen input
			  //Test win conditions
			  //Win cons are same element = tie
			  //Rock beats scissors
			  //Paper beats rock
			  //Scissors beat paper
		//Depending on win condition display “You win” or “Tie” or “You lose”
